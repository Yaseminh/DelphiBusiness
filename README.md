# FizzBuzz Project

## Overview
This is a simple **FizzBuzz** implementation in Java. The project is designed as a **junior-level exercise** to demonstrate basic programming skills, such as loops, conditionals, and modular code structure.

## Description
The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming task:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of **3**, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of **5**, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of both **3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

## Features
- Easy-to-read and maintainable Java code
- Can be extended for other ranges or rules
- Demonstrates understanding of loops and conditional statements

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (depending on project setup)
- Docker (optional, if you want to build a container.)
