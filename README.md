# FizzBuzz Project

## Concepts Applied in This Project

This project also demonstrates several **key programming concepts** often used in real-world applications:

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies rather than creating them inside classes.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the class itself to a container or framework.
- **Junior-Level Testing:** Basic unit tests are included to verify functionality, ensuring code correctness and reliability.

## Overview
This is a simple **FizzBuzz** implementation in Java. The project is designed as a **junior-level exercise** to demonstrate basic programming skills, such as loops, conditionals, and modular code structure.

## Description
The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming task:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of **3**, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of **5**, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of both **3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

## Features
- Easy-to-read and maintainable Java code
- Can be extended for other ranges or rules
- Demonstrates understanding of loops and conditional statements

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (depending on project setup)
- Docker (optional, if you want to build a container.)
